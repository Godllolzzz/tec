              The present invention provides a safety system for a wearable
              helmet that keeps a regular check on a rider in 5-minute intervals
              ensuring that whether the rider is wearing the helmet or not. The
              system has an advantage over existing techniques by generating a
              continuous warning sound attached to the regular horn of the bike
              instead of directly turning off the ignition. Existing
              technologies are directly turning the ignition off in case of
              taking off the helmet while driving which may result in a fatal
              accident on busy roads. Whereas the system turns off the ignition
              after 5 minutes of giving the alarming sound and takes a picture
              of a rider at the moment the rider takes off the helmet and sends
              the alarming message to the owner. The impact sensor is placed on
              the helmet.

              Safety airbags for two-wheelers represent a significant
              advancement in rider protection technology, aiming to mitigate the
              severity of injuries in the event of a crash. Unlike traditional
              airbags in cars, which deploy outwardly from the vehicle's
              interior, two-wheeler airbags are typically integrated into the
              rider's protective gear, such as jackets or vests. These airbags
              are equipped with sensors that detect sudden deceleration or
              impact, triggering the rapid inflation of the airbag to provide a
              cushioning effect and protect vital areas of the rider's body,
              including the chest, abdomen, and back. By absorbing and
              dispersing the impact force, safety airbags for two-wheelers can
              reduce the risk of severe injuries, particularly to the upper
              body, neck, and spine. While still relatively new, the adoption of
              this technology has the potential to enhance rider safety and
              reduce the severity of injuries in motorcycle and scooter
              accidents, underscoring its importance in improving road safety
              for two-wheeler riders.

              Mental health is a growing concern among students, with studies
              showing that many college and university students experience
              mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. Early
              detection and intervention of these challenges can help students
              manage their stress and anxiety, improving their academic
              performance and overall quality of life. This proposal presents a
              machine learning-based app that can identify students' mental
              stress by building models and predicting students’ mental stress
              levels and well-being. The proposed machine learning-based app can
              help identify students experiencing mental stress and provide
              early intervention to prevent further mental health deterioration.
              The app will use machine learning algorithms to analyse various
              parameters, including sleep patterns, social media activity,
              academic performance, and other behavioural patterns. The app will
              also provide students personalized recommendations and resources
              to manage their stress levels. The development of this app will
              require collaboration between several stakeholders, including
              university administration, mental health professionals, and
              technology experts.

              Assays. Major Expected outcomes Opioids or non-steroidal
              anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used to reduce the
              inflammation, possess severe side effects like redness, itching
              etc. Since herbal formulations have growing demand in world they
              are more accepted for their fewer side effects and lower costs
              than the synthetic drugs. The presence of a considerable number of
              bioactive compounds and photochemical like flavonoids, terpenoids,
              sterols, glycosides, and fatty acids in the plant extracts, which
              can contribute to their wound healing and anti-inflammatory
              activities. It has been shown that saponins, flavonoids, and
              phenols possess potent anti-inflammatory activity The extract of
              these plants Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa
              has wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity and extract of
              plant cannot be applied directly on skin ,so a suitable
              formulation is required for application As a result, polyherbal
              gel formulation by using these plant extract would be more
              beneficial. Societal benefits Development of topical polyherbal
              gel of (Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa)
              extract will be suitable for the treatment of moderate to severe
              type of wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity. Formulation
              of polyherbal topical gel with synergistic effect is a very
              promising approach for its treatment.{" "}

              The automated fingerprint development scanner represents a
              significant advancement in forensic technology, revolutionizing
              the process of fingerprint analysis and identification. Unlike
              traditional methods that rely on manual techniques and chemical
              processing, automated scanners employ sophisticated imaging
              technology to rapidly capture and enhance fingerprints from
              various surfaces, including paper, plastic, and metal. These
              scanners utilize advanced algorithms to enhance image clarity,
              remove background noise, and extract detailed fingerprint features
              with high accuracy. By automating the development and analysis
              process, these scanners streamline forensic investigations, reduce
              human error, and expedite the identification of suspects or
              individuals of interest. Moreover, automated fingerprint
              development scanners offer the advantage of non-destructive
              testing, preserving evidence integrity and allowing for
              re-analysis if necessary. With their ability to process large
              volumes of fingerprints efficiently, these scanners play a crucial
              role in law enforcement, border security, and criminal justice
              systems, enhancing overall investigative capabilities and
              contributing to the swift resolution of cases.
