            <p>
              <b>Introduction : </b>
              The screening of intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibition is a pivotal process in the discovery of compounds with potential anti-diabetic properties. This screening method involves testing various compounds or extracts to assess their ability to inhibit the activity of alpha-glucosidase enzymes found in the intestine. Alpha-glucosidase plays a crucial role in breaking down complex carbohydrates into simple sugars, contributing to postprandial blood glucose levels. By identifying compounds that can inhibit this enzyme, researchers aim to slow down carbohydrate digestion and absorption, thereby managing blood glucose levels. Through in vitro assays, test compounds are evaluated for their potency in inhibiting alpha-glucosidase activity, with further validation often carried out in animal models or clinical trials. This screening process serves as a foundation for the development of novel anti-diabetic drugs or functional food ingredients aimed at improving glucose control and diabetes management.

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              Safety airbags for two-wheelers represent a significant advancement in rider protection technology, aiming to mitigate the severity of injuries in the event of a crash. Unlike traditional airbags in cars, which deploy outwardly from the vehicle's interior, two-wheeler airbags are typically integrated into the rider's protective gear, such as jackets or vests. These airbags are equipped with sensors that detect sudden deceleration or impact, triggering the rapid inflation of the airbag to provide a cushioning effect and protect vital areas of the rider's body, including the chest, abdomen, and back. By absorbing and dispersing the impact force, safety airbags for two-wheelers can reduce the risk of severe injuries, particularly to the upper body, neck, and spine. While still relatively new, the adoption of this technology has the potential to enhance rider safety and reduce the severity of injuries in motorcycle and scooter accidents, underscoring its importance in improving road safety for two-wheeler riders.</p>

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              Mental health is a growing concern among students, with studies
              showing that many college and university students experience
              mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. Early
              detection and intervention of these challenges can help students
              manage their stress and anxiety, improving their academic
              performance and overall quality of life. This proposal presents a
              machine learning-based app that can identify students' mental
              stress by building models and predicting students’ mental stress
              levels and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              The proposed machine learning-based app can help identify students
              experiencing mental stress and provide early intervention to
              prevent further mental health deterioration. The app will use
              machine learning algorithms to analyse various parameters,
              including sleep patterns, social media activity, academic
              performance, and other behavioural patterns. The app will also
              provide students personalized recommendations and resources to
              manage their stress levels. The development of this app will
              require collaboration between several stakeholders, including
              university administration, mental health professionals, and

              The traditional Indian healthcare systems of Ayurveda and Siddha
              affirm the value of using medicinal plants to treat illness. The
              aim of present work is to formulate the polyherbal gel contains
              Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa extract. The
              studies also aim to evaluate the impact of polyherbalism on Wound
              Healing and Anti-Inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo
              Assays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Major Expected outcomes Opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
              drugs are widely used to reduce the inflammation, possess severe
              side effects like redness, itching etc. Since herbal formulations
              have growing demand in world they are more accepted for their
              fewer side effects and lower costs than the synthetic drugs. The
              presence of a considerable number of bioactive compounds and
              photochemical like flavonoids, terpenoids, sterols, glycosides,
              and fatty acids in the plant extracts, which can contribute to
              their wound healing and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been
              shown that saponins, flavonoids, and phenols possess potent
              anti-inflammatory activity
            </p>
            <p>
              The extract of these plants Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara
              and Moringa has wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity and
              extract of plant cannot be applied directly on skin ,so a suitable
              formulation is required for application As a result, polyherbal
              gel formulation by using these plant extract would be more
              beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Societal benefits Development of topical polyherbal gel of
              (Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa) extract will
              be suitable for the treatment of moderate to severe type of wound
              healing and anti-inflammatory activity. Formulation of polyherbal
              topical gel with synergistic effect is a very promising approach

              18-45 years, which accounts for about 67 per cent of total
              accidental deaths

            <p>
              Even after having strict road safety rules people are still not
              obeying the rules especially, in the case of two-wheelers the most
              common road safety offence is not wearing a helmet. Despite
              knowing that a helmet is not an accessory but a necessity to keep
              drivers safe, most of the reported causes of death among the
              two-wheelers are due to head injury.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are coming up with the idea of making a helmet a part of a
              two-wheeler instead of being a part of an accessory. Our
              technology will ensure that without wearing a helmet the vehicle
              will not start.
