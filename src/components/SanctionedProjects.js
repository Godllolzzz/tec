              <b>Introduction : </b>
              The screening of intestinal alpha-glucosidase inhibition is a
              pivotal process in the discovery of compounds with potential
              anti-diabetic properties. This screening method involves testing
              various compounds or extracts to assess their ability to inhibit
              the activity of alpha-glucosidase enzymes found in the intestine.
              Alpha-glucosidase plays a crucial role in breaking down complex
              carbohydrates into simple sugars, contributing to postprandial
              blood glucose levels. By identifying compounds that can inhibit
              this enzyme, researchers aim to slow down carbohydrate digestion
              and absorption, thereby managing blood glucose levels. Through in
              vitro assays, test compounds are evaluated for their potency in
              inhibiting alpha-glucosidase activity, with further validation
              often carried out in animal models or clinical trials. This
              screening process serves as a foundation for the development of
              novel anti-diabetic drugs or functional food ingredients aimed at
              improving glucose control and diabetes management.

            <p>
              <b>Introduction : </b>
              Safety airbags for two-wheelers represent a significant
              advancement in rider protection technology, aiming to mitigate the
              severity of injuries in the event of a crash. Unlike traditional
              airbags in cars, which deploy outwardly from the vehicle's
              interior, two-wheeler airbags are typically integrated into the
              rider's protective gear, such as jackets or vests. These airbags
              are equipped with sensors that detect sudden deceleration or
              impact, triggering the rapid inflation of the airbag to provide a
              cushioning effect and protect vital areas of the rider's body,
              including the chest, abdomen, and back. By absorbing and
              dispersing the impact force, safety airbags for two-wheelers can
              reduce the risk of severe injuries, particularly to the upper
              body, neck, and spine. While still relatively new, the adoption of
              this technology has the potential to enhance rider safety and
              reduce the severity of injuries in motorcycle and scooter
              accidents, underscoring its importance in improving road safety
              for two-wheeler riders.

              The automated fingerprint development scanner represents a
              significant advancement in forensic technology, revolutionizing
              the process of fingerprint analysis and identification. Unlike
              traditional methods that rely on manual techniques and chemical
              processing, automated scanners employ sophisticated imaging
              technology to rapidly capture and enhance fingerprints from
              various surfaces, including paper, plastic, and metal. These
              scanners utilize advanced algorithms to enhance image clarity,
              remove background noise, and extract detailed fingerprint features
              with high accuracy. By automating the development and analysis
              process, these scanners streamline forensic investigations, reduce
              human error, and expedite the identification of suspects or
              individuals of interest. Moreover, automated fingerprint
              development scanners offer the advantage of non-destructive
              testing, preserving evidence integrity and allowing for
              re-analysis if necessary. With their ability to process large
              volumes of fingerprints efficiently, these scanners play a crucial

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              Mental health is a growing concern among students, with studies
              showing that many college and university students experience
              mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. Early
              detection and intervention of these challenges can help students
              manage their stress and anxiety, improving their academic
              performance and overall quality of life. This proposal presents a
              machine learning-based app that can identify students' mental
              stress by building models and predicting students’ mental stress
              levels and well-being.
            </p>
            <p>
              The proposed machine learning-based app can help identify students
              experiencing mental stress and provide early intervention to
              prevent further mental health deterioration. The app will use
              machine learning algorithms to analyse various parameters,
              including sleep patterns, social media activity, academic
              performance, and other behavioural patterns. The app will also
              provide students personalized recommendations and resources to
              manage their stress levels. The development of this app will
              require collaboration between several stakeholders, including
              university administration, mental health professionals, and

              aim of present work is to formulate the polyherbal gel contains
              Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa extract. The
              studies also aim to evaluate the impact of polyherbalism on Wound
              Healing and Anti-Inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo
              Assays.
            </p>
            <p>
              Major Expected outcomes Opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
              drugs are widely used to reduce the inflammation, possess severe
              side effects like redness, itching etc. Since herbal formulations
              have growing demand in world they are more accepted for their
              fewer side effects and lower costs than the synthetic drugs. The
              presence of a considerable number of bioactive compounds and
              photochemical like flavonoids, terpenoids, sterols, glycosides,
              and fatty acids in the plant extracts, which can contribute to
              their wound healing and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been
              shown that saponins, flavonoids, and phenols possess potent
              anti-inflammatory activity
            </p>
            <p>
              The extract of these plants Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara
              and Moringa has wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity and
              extract of plant cannot be applied directly on skin ,so a suitable
              formulation is required for application As a result, polyherbal
              gel formulation by using these plant extract would be more
              beneficial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Societal benefits Development of topical polyherbal gel of
              (Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa) extract will
              be suitable for the treatment of moderate to severe type of wound
              healing and anti-inflammatory activity. Formulation of polyherbal
              topical gel with synergistic effect is a very promising approach
              for its treatment.

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              Road safety continues to be a major developmental issue, a public
              health concern and a leading cause of death and injury across the
              world. At least one out of 10 people killed on roads across the
              world is from India, according to the World Health Organization.
              The cost of road accidents is borne not only by the victims and
              their families but by the economy in terms of untimely deaths,
              injuries, disabilities and loss of potential income. It is indeed
              a matter of great concern that despite the continuing efforts of
              the Government in this regard and our commitments to halving
              fatalities we have not been able to register significant progress
              on this front. During the year 2021, a total number of 4,12,432
              road accidents have been reported in the country, claiming
              1,53,972 lives and causing injuries to 3,84,448 persons.
              Unfortunately, the worst affected age group in Road accidents is
              18-45 years, which accounts for about 67 per cent of total
              accidental deaths
            </p>
            <p>
              Even after having strict road safety rules people are still not
              obeying the rules especially, in the case of two-wheelers the most
              common road safety offence is not wearing a helmet. Despite
              knowing that a helmet is not an accessory but a necessity to keep
              drivers safe, most of the reported causes of death among the
              two-wheelers are due to head injury.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are coming up with the idea of making a helmet a part of a
              two-wheeler instead of being a part of an accessory. Our
              technology will ensure that without wearing a helmet the vehicle
              will not start.

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              This innovative approach to agro-waste management introduces a
              sustainable and practical solution by utilizing mushroom
              cultivation to recycle and repurpose agricultural waste. Instead
              of allowing crop residues such as straw, husks, stalks, and other
              biomass to go unused or be burned—contributing to pollution—this
              method transforms them into a productive growing medium for
              mushrooms. The process not only reduces environmental impact but
              also adds value to materials that are typically discarded. By
              converting agro-waste into a nutrient-rich substrate for mushroom
              farming, this approach promotes circular economy principles within
              the agricultural sector. It emphasizes resource efficiency by
              making full use of available biomass and minimizing waste. As
              mushrooms grow on the agro-waste substrate, they generate
              nutritious food and high-value by-products such as compost, which
              can further enrich soil health and be used as organic fertilizer.
              Beyond environmental benefits, this model creates new economic
              opportunities, particularly for small and marginal farmers, rural
              communities, and agri-based entrepreneurs. Mushroom cultivation
              requires relatively low investment, has a short cultivation cycle,
              and can be scaled to fit local needs, making it a viable source of
              income generation. Additionally, the increasing demand for
              mushrooms in domestic and export markets further enhances its
              potential as a profitable enterprise. Ultimately, this integrated
              method supports sustainable agricultural practices, enhances rural
              livelihoods, and contributes to the broader goals of environmental
              conservation and economic resilience in the farming sector. It
              exemplifies how innovative, low-cost technologies can drive
              sustainable development and empower communities through green
              entrepreneurship.

              <b>Introduction : </b>
              The Smart Irrigation System represents a significant advancement
              in modern agricultural technology, offering an intelligent and
              efficient solution to water management through the integration of
              Internet of Things (IoT) technology. This system is designed to
              revolutionize traditional irrigation methods by enabling precision
              control and real-time monitoring of essential parameters such as
              soil moisture levels, temperature, and weather conditions. At the
              core of the system is a network of smart sensors that collect data
              from the field and transmit it to a centralized control unit. This
              data is then analyzed to determine the exact water requirements of
              crops, ensuring that irrigation is applied only when and where it
              is needed. By automating the irrigation process, the system
              drastically reduces water wastage, conserves energy, and improves
              overall crop yield and quality. An additional feature that sets
              this system apart is its integrated laser security mechanism,
              which helps protect agricultural fields and equipment from
              unauthorized access and potential threats. This laser-based
              perimeter security adds a layer of physical protection,
              safeguarding valuable resources and infrastructure in remote
              farming areas. By combining precision agriculture with smart
              security solutions, the Smart Irrigation System embodies the
              principles of sustainable and smart farming. It supports optimal
              resource utilization, reduces labor dependency, and helps farmers
              make data-driven decisions, thereby increasing productivity and
              profitability. This technology-driven approach is particularly
              suited to meet the challenges of modern agriculture, especially in
              water-scarce regions. It empowers farmers with greater control,
              real-time insights, and reliable protection—paving the way for a
              more resilient and technologically empowered agricultural sector.
