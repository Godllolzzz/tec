                        <p><b>Introduction : </b>

                            Mental health is a growing concern among students, with studies showing that many college and university students experience mental health challenges such as anxiety and depression. Early detection and intervention of these challenges can help students manage their stress and anxiety, improving their academic performance and overall quality of life. This proposal presents a machine learning-based app that can identify students' mental stress by building models and predicting students’ mental stress levels and well-being.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The proposed machine learning-based app can help identify students experiencing mental stress and provide early intervention to prevent further mental health deterioration. The app will use machine learning algorithms to analyse various parameters, including sleep patterns, social media activity, academic performance, and other behavioural patterns. The app will also provide students personalized recommendations and resources to manage their stress levels. The development of this app will require collaboration between several stakeholders, including university administration, mental health professionals, and technology experts.

                        <p><b>Introduction : </b>

                            We know that people have their unlimited wants. If one want is completed other is automatically created and it is going continuously. Due to this economic activity and economic process is going on. As population is increasing day by day so the demand of the general services also increases. To complete these at time bound at reasonable charges is the main challenges at national as well as international level. To complete this we have created so many employment opportunities and help to India to become self-reliant this is the main need of the hour. The overall purpose of this market research is study to develop a bridging tool to fulfil the demand of the nonworking population by the working population.

                        </p>
                        <p>Specific objective to be addressed because of the study are:

                                <li>
                                    To match the demand and supply of these two with the help of online bridging tool within a specific framework of time.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Expected outcomes of this project to find an effective online tool which fulfil the demand the non-working population of a locality through the working population at reasonable charges and in time bound commitment. Society will take the advantages of this online tool and will find all the general identified services at reasonable charges.
                            In teaching it will inspire the students as well as faculty to join this and take the advantages of it and it can be generalized at large level with the logo of Bundelkhand University, Jhansi.

                            The traditional Indian healthcare systems of Ayurveda and Siddha affirm the value of using medicinal plants to treat illness. The aim of present work is to formulate the polyherbal gel contains Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa extract. The studies also aim to evaluate the impact of polyherbalism on Wound Healing and Anti-Inflammatory activity using in vitro and in vivo Assays.

                        <p>
                            Major Expected outcomes
                            Opioids or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used to reduce the inflammation, possess severe side effects like redness, itching etc. Since herbal formulations have growing demand in world they are more accepted for their fewer side effects and lower costs than the synthetic drugs.
                            The presence of a considerable number of bioactive compounds and photochemical like flavonoids, terpenoids, sterols, glycosides, and fatty acids in the plant extracts, which can contribute to their wound healing and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been shown that saponins, flavonoids, and phenols possess potent anti-inflammatory activity


                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The extract of these plants Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa has wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity and extract of plant cannot be applied directly on skin ,so a suitable formulation is required for application As a result, polyherbal gel formulation by using these plant extract would be more beneficial.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Societal benefits
                            Development of topical polyherbal gel of (Holoptelea Integrifolia, Albizia Amara and Moringa) extract will be suitable for the treatment of moderate to severe type of wound healing and anti-inflammatory activity. Formulation of polyherbal topical gel with synergistic effect is a very promising approach for its treatment.

                        <p><b>Introduction : </b>


                        Road safety continues to be a major developmental issue, a public health concern and a leading cause of death and injury across the world. At least one out of 10 people killed on roads across the world is from India, according to the World Health Organization. The cost of road accidents is borne not only by the victims and their families but by the economy in terms of untimely deaths, injuries, disabilities and loss of potential income. It is indeed a matter of great concern that despite the continuing efforts of the Government in this regard and our commitments to halving fatalities we have not been able to register significant progress on this front. During the year 2021, a total number of 4,12,432 road accidents have been reported in the country, claiming 1,53,972 lives and causing injuries to 3,84,448 persons. Unfortunately, the worst affected age group in Road accidents is 18-45 years, which accounts for about 67 per cent of total accidental deaths



                        </p>
                        <p>
                        Even after having strict road safety rules people are still not obeying the rules especially, in the case of two-wheelers the most common road safety offence is not wearing a helmet. Despite knowing that a helmet is not an accessory but a necessity to keep drivers safe, most of the reported causes of death among the two-wheelers are due to head injury.   


                        </p>
                        <p>
                        We are coming up with the idea of making a helmet a part of a two-wheeler instead of being a part of an accessory. Our technology will ensure that without wearing a helmet the vehicle will not start.
